Let's launch this on a domain


- Does not support multiple requests at same time??

Need to add progress bar to front end.

Add advertisement while clip is being mixed.

Video preview on front end not working with Opera

On mobile safari, gets stuck on "Uploading Video"

Question - Does saving every uploaded primary clip and generated clip take up space? Can we make both delete after they preview and are downloadable to save space?

Can't skip forward in front-end video player

cut off the top of the secondary clip to make the uploaded clip take up more of the screen (close to half)
    - Send Arbind examples of sludge clips that I want to emulate.
